            <h3>How to play</h3>
                        The game consists of many rounds as many player are playing and the maximum is 6 players. The
                        game ends when all the players has a turn to draw and the winners will be displayed on everyone's screen.
                        One player will draw a given word and other player will try to guess the word in one minute.

                        The objective of the game is to draw a word known only to you, and based on your drawing, other players
                        try to guess the secret word. You can use any artistic method to make your drawing easier to guess.
                        However, you are not allowed to use non-artistic clues, such as writing letters.

            <br>
            <h4>As the Guesser:</h4>
                        As guessers, you will be typing your in the message box.Your guesses are visible to the
                        other players except when you have guessed the word. When you have guessed the word right,
                        your name in chat will turn green. E.g. "Jack has guessed the word." At the end of the round,
                        the word will appear on top of the drawing.

            <br>
            <h4>As the Artist:</h4>
                        As artist, you see the word appear above the drawing board and in the chat. Then you will have
                        exactly one minute to draw the word while the guessers have same amount of time to guess the word.
                        The guesser will see blanks corresponding to the word. So its easy for them to guess. When the round ends,
                        you see the "Finish" button to end your turn.
                        - If the artist will receive 2 points if the anyone player is guesses word.

            <br>
            <h4>As for Scoring</h4>
            <p> The guesser will only receive point for the correct guess.<br>
                   - If a player guess's the word first, the player is receive point 3 points.<br>
                   - If a player guess's the word second, the player is receive point 2 points.<br>
                   - If a player guess's the word third, the player is receive point 1 points.<br>

                for guessing quickly, drawing effectively and getting as many correct guessers as you can.
